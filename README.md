This repository contains the markdown source code and and pandoc template for a  document, which contains many exercises for German language learners.

# Approach

Initially I intended to make a 3 language document, containing German, English and Chinese. There are problems with such an approach however.

* It takes a lot of space inside the document for each exercise or item, that is translated into 3 languages.
* Adding Chinese translations is a task, that consumes lots of time, as I cannot come up with the translations myself, because I am not a native speaker and have no idea how one would write the instructions in Chinese. It seems to be quite complicating to clearly distinguish colloquial "or" and logical "or" and logical "exclusive or" for example. It requires a native speaker or at least a very proficient Chinese speaker to write such phrases.
* Currently I have no one who can help translate this document into Chinese.

So I started working on a version, which has only German and English translations.
